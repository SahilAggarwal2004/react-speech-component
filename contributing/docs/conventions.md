# Conventions

## Names

- When you write names such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Next.js, etc., do it correctly. No Typescript, Javascript, Node, NodeJS, Next, or NextJS.

## Grammar

- Attempt to make as few grammar errors as possible. Thank you. A distinct lack of grammar errors... simply delivers a sense of professionalism I struggle to find anywhere else. Consider this my selfish request.
