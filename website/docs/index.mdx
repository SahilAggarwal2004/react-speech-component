# Introduction

**react-text-to-speech** is an easy-to-use React.js component that leverages the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to convert text to speech.

## Features

- Text-to-speech functionality
- Easy to use
- Highlights words as they are read (see highlighting text using [useSpeech Hook](/docs/usage/useSpeech#highlight-text) and [Speech Component](/docs/usage/speech#highlight-text)).
- Provides API to handle errors and events (see [Handling Errors and Events](/docs/usage/useSpeech#handling-errors-and-events)).
- Handles multiple speech instances easily (see handling using [useSpeech Hook](/docs/usage/useSpeech#multiple-instance-usage) and [Speech Component](/docs/usage/speech#multiple-instance-usage)).
- Fully Customizable (see [useSpeech Hook Usage](/docs/usage/useSpeech) and [usage with FaC](/docs/usage/speech#full-customization)).
- Overcomes the [Web Speech API's text limit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance/text), allowing for infinite text input.
- Automatically stops speech instances on component unmount.
